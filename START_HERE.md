## 🚀 Quick Decision Points

### Before You Start Building:

**1. What's Our Tech Stack?**
- **Decision (locked):** Next.js (React) frontend + FastAPI (Python) backend
- **DB:** SQLite in dev by default, Postgres in prod (Supabase preferred)
- **Docker:** Optional in dev (for Postgres parity), recommended in prod

**2. Real Data or Demo Data?**
- **Primary:** Plaid Sandbox (safe, consistent)
- **Fallback:** Synthetic data or CSV upload

**3. Who's Doing What?**
- Backend Lead (ML algorithms)
- Data Engineer (Plaid/Teller integration)
- Frontend Developer (dosha wheel viz)
- Designer (Ayurvedic aesthetics)
- PM/Strategist (pitch, demo script)

👉 Assign roles now

## 📋 Pre-Build Checklist

Before writing code, make sure:
- [ ] All team members read README.md
- [ ] All team members read HACKATHON_PLAN.md
- [ ] Tech stack decided
- [ ] Roles assigned
- [ ] Git repo initialized
- [ ] Everyone has dev environment setup
- [ ] Demo data strategy chosen

## 🎯 Success Criteria (Tomorrow)

**Minimum:**
- [ ] Working dosha classification
- [ ] Beautiful dosha wheel visualization
- [ ] Smooth demo (doesn't crash)
- [ ] Clear 60-second pitch

**Goal:**
- [ ] Above + top 10 finish
- [ ] Team wants to continue post-hackathon
- [ ] Judges say "this is interesting"

**Stretch:**
- [ ] Win or place (top 3)
- [ ] Investor/advisor interest expressed
- [ ] Social media buzz

## 💡 The Core Insight

**Remember:**
> We're not building another fintech app. We're building the bridge between modern data science and ancient wisdom.

**The pitch in one sentence:**
> Personal finance apps track WHAT you spend. We diagnose WHY - using ML + 5,000 years of Ayurvedic wisdom.

## 🔮 The Three Financial Doshas (Learn These)

**Vata (Air)** 🌪️
- Impulsive, scattered, late-night shopping
- Example: 23 late-night purchases, subscription chaos

**Pitta (Fire)** 🔥
- Intense, competitive, status-driven
- Example: Premium merchants, experience spending

**Kapha (Earth)** 🏔️
- Risk-averse, stagnant, cash-hoarding
- Example: Same merchants repeatedly, essential only

## 🎤 The 60-Second Pitch

Memorize this structure:
1. **Hook** (5s): "Who stress-shops at midnight?"
2. **Problem** (10s): "Apps track spending, don't explain behavior"
3. **Solution** (15s): "ML + Ayurveda = financial personality diagnosis"
4. **Demo** (20s): "My algorithm found I'm 65% Vata..."
5. **Why It Works** (10s): "Five ML models, ancient framework"

## ⚡ Quick Reference

**APIs Available (Primary):**
- Plaid Sandbox: Unlimited calls, demo data ✅
- Teller: 100 free real connections (optional)
- Open Banking: Varies by region (future)

**ML Models to Build:**
- Feature extraction (transaction patterns)
- Dosha classification (Random Forest)
- Anomaly detection (time-series)
- Recommendations (rule-based for MVP)

**Must-Have Features:**
1. Data input (Plaid Sandbox)
2. Transaction‑based dosha scoring (not just a quiz)
3. Dosha wheel visualization (animated)
4. Specific insights (behavioral examples)
5. Personalized recommendations

## 🆘 If You're Stuck

**Technical Issues:**
- Check HACKATHON_PLAN.md for backup plans
- Have multiple demo data options ready
- Record video backup of demo

**Strategic Questions:**
- Check VISION.md for the big picture
- Check COMMERCIAL.md for business model
- Check FRAMEWORKS.md for dosha details

**Pitch Help:**
- Full script in HACKATHON_PLAN.md
- Q&A prep in COMMERCIAL.md
- Demo flow in HACKATHON_PLAN.md

## 📞 Communication

**During Build Day:**
- Quick stand-ups every 2 hours
- Slack/Discord for async questions
- Final full rehearsal 1 hour before demo

**Roles Communicate:**
- Backend ↔ Data Engineer (data format)
- Backend ↔ Frontend (API contracts)
- Designer ↔ Frontend (component specs)
- PM ↔ Everyone (demo script alignment)

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

**Ayurvedic Aesthetic:**
- Colors: Earthy (browns, golds, deep greens)
- Typography: Serene, readable
- Imagery: Sacred geometry, elements (air, fire, earth)
- Animation: Smooth, meditative, not frantic

**Dosha Wheel:**
- Circular chart (Vata/Pitta/Kapha percentages)
- Animated on reveal
- Element symbols for each dosha
- Interactive (hover for details)

## ✅ Final Checks Before Demo

- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Live site deployed (Vercel/Heroku)
- [ ] Demo video recorded (backup)
- [ ] Pitch practiced 3x
- [ ] Q&A responses prepared
- [ ] All team members know their roles
- [ ] Laptop charged, backup laptop ready
- [ ] Network connection tested

## 🚀 Post-Hackathon (If We Continue)

**Week 1:**
- Clean up code
- Get 100 beta users
- Share on Product Hunt

**Month 1:**
- Apply to Y Combinator
- Add wearables integration
- Iterate based on feedback

**See COMMERCIAL.md for full roadmap**
