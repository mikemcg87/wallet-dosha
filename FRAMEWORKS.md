- ✅ Avoid claiming expertise you don't have
- ✅ Share revenue with traditional knowledge keepers (if applicable)
- ❌ Don't strip cultural context
- ❌ Don't claim frameworks as your invention
- ❌ Don't use sacred symbols without permission

### Handling Skepticism
When people question validity:
- Lead with research (HRV studies, genomic studies)
- Emphasize "framework for interpretation" not "medical diagnosis"
- Acknowledge limits of current scientific understanding
- Show ML validation metrics (classification accuracy)
- User testimonials ("this felt accurate for me")
