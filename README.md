## 🎯 Quick Start: What Are We Building?

### Phase 1: Wallet Dosha (Hackathon → MVP)

**One-Line Pitch:**
> Personal finance apps track spending. We diagnose WHY you spend - using ML + 5,000 years of Ayurvedic wisdom.

**The Three Financial Doshas:**

🌪️ **Vata (Air)** - Impulsive, scattered, late-night shopping
- 23 late-night purchases detected
- High spending volatility
- Subscription chaos
- Irregular income

🔥 **Pitta (Fire)** - Intense, competitive, status-driven
- Premium merchants
- Weekend experience spending
- Investment-aggressive
- Competitive upgrades

🏔️ **Kapha (Earth)** - Risk-averse, stagnant, cash-hoarding
- Essential purchases only
- Same merchants repeatedly
- Low transaction frequency
- Difficulty parting with money

### How It Works:

```
1. Connect bank (Plaid Sandbox) or use synthetic data
2. ML/heuristics extract behavioral features from transactions
3. Classification model predicts your dosha balance
4. Optional 60‑second quiz refines confidence
5. Personalized recommendations + insights
```

### ML/AI Features:
- Transaction feature extraction (timing, volatility, merchant diversity)
- Dosha scoring/classification (heuristic → ML upgrade path)
- Optional LLM narrative insights
- Recommendation engine (personalized interventions)

---

## 🚀 Why This Will Work

### 1. Novel Category
**No one has done this.** Finance + ancient wisdom = unexplored territory.

### 2. Research Validated
- Ayurvedic doshas correlate with HRV (Kappa score 0.78)
- Genomic studies finding dosha markers
- Stress response patterns differ by constitution

### 3. Market Timing
- Wellness boom ($1.5T global market)
- AI capabilities now accessible
- Meaning crisis (people want understanding, not just metrics)
- Personalization demand

### 4. Platform Potential
Not just one app. It's an **interpretation layer** for any behavioral data through any wisdom framework.

```
[Any Data Source] → [Feature Extraction] → [Framework Adapter] → [Personalized Insights]
                                            ├─ Ayurveda
                                            ├─ TCM
                                            ├─ Enneagram
                                            └─ Custom
```

### 5. Multiple Revenue Streams
- B2C: Consumer wellness app ($7.99/mo)
- B2B: Financial advisor tools ($99-999/mo)
- White-label: Bank/fintech partnerships ($100K-500K/year)
- Data insights: Research/marketing API (coming later)

## 🎓 Research & Validation

### Ayurveda + Modern Science:
- **HRV Correlation:** Dosha types show distinct heart rate variability patterns (78% agreement with practitioner assessment)
- **Genomic Studies:** CSIR-TRISUTRA consortium finding genetic markers for Prakriti (constitution)
- **Stress Response:** Vata, Pitta, Kapha show different HRV responses to orthostatic stress
- **Metabolic Differences:** Published studies showing dosha-specific metabolism

### Behavioral Finance Research:
- 50% of people can't afford $500 emergency (not tracking problem, behavior problem)
- Loss aversion, present bias, mental accounting affect financial decisions
- Personality predicts financial outcomes (conscientiousness → savings, neuroticism → debt)

---

## 🌍 Cultural Considerations

### Respectful Implementation:
✅ Acknowledge Ayurvedic origins & cultural context
✅ Cite traditional texts (Charaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita)
✅ Consult with Ayurvedic practitioners
✅ Share revenue with traditional knowledge keepers
✅ Frame as "interpretive framework" not "medical diagnosis"

❌ Don't strip cultural context
❌ Don't claim frameworks as invention
❌ Don't use sacred symbols without permission

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### North Star Metric:
**Active Weekly Users with Constitutional Profile Confidence >70%**

### Key Metrics:
- Activation: Bank connection success rate, time to first insight
- Engagement: WAU/MAU, sessions per week, insight CTR
- Retention: D7/D30 retention, monthly churn <5%
- Revenue: Free→paid conversion 10%+, LTV:CAC 8:1
- Product: NPS >50, "feels accurate" >70%

---

## 🏆 Competitive Advantage

### Our Moat:
1. **First Mover** - Genuinely novel category
2. **Technical IP** - ML models trained on dosha-transaction correlations
3. **Data Flywheel** - More users → better classification → more users
4. **Brand** - "Financial dosha" owned mindshare
5. **Platform** - Framework adapter tech (any data → any wisdom framework)

### No Direct Competitors:
- Mint, YNAB, etc.: Tracking, not behavioral diagnosis
- Personality tests: No financial application
- Ayurvedic apps: No ML/data science integration
- Behavioral finance: Academic, not consumer-facing

## 💡 Key Insights

### What We Learned:
1. **Ancient wisdom holds up** - Doshas correlate with measurable biometrics
2. **People want meaning** - Metrics without context don't change behavior
3. **Framework matters** - Same data, different lens, different insights
4. **Platform beats product** - This isn't just one app, it's infrastructure

### What Makes This Special:
> We're not building another fintech app. We're building the Rosetta Stone between modern data and ancient wisdom.

### The Bigger Vision:
This is Phase 1. The platform can reinterpret ANY behavioral data (sleep, work, nutrition, social) through ANY wisdom framework (Ayurveda, TCM, Enneagram, custom).

**We're building an anthropological data layer for understanding human behavior.**
